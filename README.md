# Remote Sensing Notebooks

This project contains analysis workflows in a variety of languages (mostly
Python, but stay tuned for more Clojure and Julia) for Earth and Planetary
Remote Sensing. Warning: I only have real expertise in the former.

## Who am I?

I'm a Geography PhD and remote sensing specialist by training. I left academia
and am now a software engineer w/various hats as my present day job. I love
hacking at remote sensing datasets, scientific programming, and have a hobby
interest in the Astronomy side and a little professional experience from
working for a few years as an IDL instructor and elsewhere in the space
industry.

I'm also an ex-archaeologists, and as a result have a pretty eclectic
[publication record](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HShNeNsAAAAJ&hl=en).

You can reach out to me at ben dot kamphaus @ gmail with any questions. If you
work in the Climate Change or Astronomy fields I'm always happy to discuss
opportunities to provide a few hours of pro-bono consulting/coding.

## What's this project all about?

I'm trying to document some of the processes and workflows involved w/working
with scientific datasets and remote sensing analysis. My goals are:

* Free tools -- I'd prefer anyone be able to follow along. Realistically, the
  difficulty of getting tools setup will block some people, but I don't want $$
  to block them. I'm happy to use tools that have a free version, though.
* Polyglot -- A lot of the best libraries are in Python. My favorite language
  at the moment is Clojure. Julia is an upcoming language that looks pretty
  promising. I don't want this to be a place for language wars, though. A
  language is just a tool and I'd like to use the right tool for the right job.
* Document sausage making -- a lot of times people just see pretty pictures or
  cool parts of the toolchain/workflow. I don't mind documenting the
  frustrations I run into trying to get the right info out of a FITS or HDF
  file.
* From script to program -- in my instructor/consulting days I saw a lot of
  scientists struggle with the process of going from giant unwieldy scripts
  that performed a few steps of analysis in order to attacking problems with
  a set of more general purpose tools. Notebooks are great for capturing
  workflows, but I also want to capture the process of going from step-by-step
  analysis to creating good scientific software tools.
